# Othello
This project is an implementation of “Othello”, a two player board game, using Minimax Algorithm and further extending it with Alpha Beta Pruning Algorithm. This program, when run on any up-to-date computer, is expected to defeat an average player. This is because although the consequences of moves are predictable for both computers and humans, computers are better at envisaging them.
