# Othello
This project is an implementation of “Othello”, a two player board game, using Minimax Algorithm and further extending it with Alpha Beta Pruning Algorithm. This program, when run on any up-to-date computer, is expected to defeat an average player. This is because although the consequences of moves are predictable for both computers and humans, computers are better at envisaging them.
1. Introduction
Human intelligence is shaped by what is most important to us—the things that cause ecstasy, despair, pleasure, pain, and other intense emotions. Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence exhibited by machines or software. It is an academic field of study which studies the goal of creating intelligence. It is also defined as "the study and design of intelligent agents", where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success. John McCarthy, who coined the term in 1955, defines it as "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines". In computer games, artificial intelligence is used to generate intelligent behaviors primarily in non-player characters (NPCs), often simulating human-like intelligence. The techniques used typically draw upon existing methods from the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Game playing was an area of research in AI from its inception.
